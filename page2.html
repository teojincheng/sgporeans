    <h4>Paper Crane</h4>
<div>
   Jane put down the paper on the table and headed towards the other end of the hospital ward.    <br/>
    Balakrishnan with his hands shaking, folded the paper in his hands. 
He was smiling and eager to finish folding the paper cranes and give them out. 
    <br/>
   'Why are you taking so long?' Jane asked loudly, she had came back to the table. Balakrishnan's hand continued shaking as he handled the paper. He suddenly noticed that Jane was looking directly at his face. 
    <br/> 
Balakrishnan gritted his teeth. Memories of facing other unpleasant situations surfaced in his mind. He felt a kind of tightness near his chest as he stood up. 
    <br/>
'Mr Bala, how are you?' a cheerful voice filled the hospital ward. Balakrishnan turned his head. It was Cassie, one of the officer working in the hospital.  
    <br/>
'Thank you for coming down to volunteer today. ' Cassie bowed slightly towards Balakrishnan. Balakrishnan felt his shoulders dropped slightly. 
<br/>
   <br/>
-End-
      <br/>
    
    <br/>

The short story above focuses on Balakrishnan's experience when he was  volunteering.
<br/>

Some retired elderly Singaporeans might engage in community based lifestyles to maintain their ideal images as useful and relevant citizens in societies.
