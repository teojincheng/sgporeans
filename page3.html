    <h4>Halloween</h4>
    The tourist attraction Sand-Toe-Sa is bringing in a new programme for next year's Halloween.
    <br/>
    This new offering is not named yet. Guests will board a bus driven by a professional driver in this experience.
    <br/>
    A spokesperson for the attraction mentioned that guests will 'fear for their lives' as everyone 
    <br/> 
    will be made to climb up the stairs to the upper deck of the bus while the bus is moving. 
    <br/>
    Don't miss this harrowing experience! 
<br/>
    <br/>
   The satirical piece above is trying to bring to attention one unpleasant experience while riding a public bus.
<br/>
 There are different way a bus ride can make a person feel uncomfortable. That may be one plausible reason why Singaporeans like the idea of purchasing a car. 
  <br/>
    <br/>
    In the year 1980, out of a sample population of 290, 10% of Singaporeans wanted to buy a new car for the upcoming year.
    <br/>
    This figure was published by Ogilvy & Mather.
    <br/>
    This piece of information was published in The Business Times in 7 August 1980.
