    <h4>Short Story</h4>
    <div>
      After hearing a sound, Lisa left her bedroom and looked for its source. Lisa’s mother;Heng Hua, was inside the washroom, seemingly vomiting. 
   <br/>
Thoughts swirled in Lisa’s mind, her  palm sweating a little bit. 
<br/>
‘What is happening ?’ Lisa asked, standing outside the washroom door. 
      <br/>
Her mother was apparently still in discomfort and did not reply. 
<br/>
About a minute later, Heng Hua came out of the washroom,her eyebrows furrowed and her body swayed as she walked. She used to have a history of having seizures. Without knowing what happened to her, Lisa is uncertain how to respond to the situation.Lisa scratched her head feeling confused.
<br/>
Lisa continued asking questions as her mother headed towards the bedroom. She looked at her smartphone’s clock,  gauging how long her mother had been feeling sick. Monitoring the situation is important in case there is an emergency.
<br/>
Lisa checked in on Heng Hua for the next half an hour. Lisa noticed her mother’s chest rising and falling as she slept. Lisa went back to sleep.
