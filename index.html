    <h4>Meeting point</h4>
<div>
‘Thud, Thud, Thud” Arif was dribbling a basketball. Yeo was standing beside him, talking about a lecturer in school. 
<br/>
‘That may be true, but Miss Wang sometimes arrives late for lectures.’ Arif stated.  Yeo nodded, he extended his arms and mimed how Miss Wang sometimes gestured during her lectures. 
<br/>
Arif laughed loudly, holding his basketball close to him. He stopped upon realising that people were staring at him as they passed by. Vicky approached both of them, the three of them were going to practice playing basketball. 
<br/>
‘Since we are just outside Food King, shall we go inside and grab a quick bite?’ Vicky asked. Arif looked down on the floor. A crease was slowly becoming visible between Yeo’s eyebrows. 
<br/>
‘We are going to Queenstown after basketball, remember? Let’s hurry to the basketball court already. ’ Yeo exclaimed. 
<br/>

The focus of the short story above is the fact that people frequently gather at an eatery before going somewhere else. In this story, the characters were at a place known as 'Food King' before heading to play basketball.  
<br/>

The results of a survey on 200 youths aged between 12 and 24 revealed that <b>70%</b> of the individuals who regularly <b>visit McDonalds</b> actually <b>didn’t like</b> the food. It was <b>suggested</b> that the restaurant is a <b>>place</b> for people to meet each other <b>before going out or going home</b>.
