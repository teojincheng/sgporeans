In 2004, Singapore’s National Kidney Foundation(NKF) sued Singapore Press Holdings for defamation.  The trial for the lawsuit began in July 2005. Information relating to the financial situation in NKF, the salary of NKF’s CEO; Mr Durai, and his conduct in the organisation was revealed during the trial. 
A petition for Mr Durai to be expelled from NKF was created online. The petition received more than 18,000 signatures at midnight between 12 and 13 July 2005.(Reference: The Straits Times, 14 Jul 2005)

    <h4>Paper Crane</h4>
<div>
   Jane put down the paper on the table and headed towards the other end of the hospital ward.    <br/>
    Balakrishnan with his hands shaking, folded the paper in his hands. 
He was smiling and eager to finish folding the paper cranes and give them out. 
    <br/>
   'Why are you taking so long?' Jane asked loudly, she had came back to the table. Balakrishnan's hand continued shaking as he handled the paper. He suddenly noticed that Jane was looking directly at his face. 
    <br/> 
Balakrishnan gritted his teeth. Memories of facing other unpleasant situations surfaced in his mind. He felt a kind of tightness near his chest as he stood up. 
    <br/>
'Mr Bala, how are you?' a cheerful voice filled the hospital ward. Balakrishnan turned his head. It was Cassie, one of the officer working in the hospital.  
    <br/>
'Thank you for coming down to volunteer today. ' Cassie bowed slightly towards Balakrishnan. Balakrishnan felt his shoulders dropped slightly. 
<br/>
   <br/>
-End-
      <br/>
    
    <br/>

The short story above focuses on Balakrishnan's experience when he was  volunteering.
