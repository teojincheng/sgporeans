    Primary schools and secondary schools are continuously finding people to operate individual food stalls inside the school canteens for long periods of time. 
<br/>
According to news reports and letters sent to The Straits Times,
school canteen stallholders faced financial challenges. Individuals written their suggestions in their letters (in October 2024) too.  
<br/>
It was claimed that stallholders were trying to provide healthier food which is more expensive. While doing that, they also have to make the food affordable 
for the students. This was a difficult situation. 
<br/>
Emulating the lunch programme in Japanese schools was suggested by an individual. The students are provided food and also given duties to help
serve lunch in the classroom. 
<br/>
Another member of the public talked about the government in France managing school canteens. It was emphasized that there is a culture of sitting down for a meal over there. Providing food to the students is also similar to providing education.
